# Computer Vision Labs Repository

Welcome to the **Computer Vision Labs** repository! This repository contains practical implementations of various **Computer Vision** techniques explored throughout a series of labs during the coursework. Each lab covers different aspects of image processing, classification, and feature extraction, with hands-on examples to understand key concepts in image analysis.

## Labs Overview

### **Lab 1: Point Processing in Image Processing**
- **Objective**: Explore basic image processing operations that manipulate the pixel values of an image. This lab focuses on techniques like contrast adjustment, brightness enhancement, and image thresholding using point operations.

### **Lab 2: Image Convolution Lab**
- **Objective**: Learn the fundamentals of image convolution and its applications. This lab delves into the use of kernels to apply filters on images, including blurring, sharpening, and edge detection. The basics of convolution are explored to understand its significance in computer vision tasks.

### **Lab 3: Bag of Visual Words (BoVW) for Image Classification**
- **Objective**: 
   - **BoVW** is a popular technique in image classification, inspired by the "Bag of Words" approach in Natural Language Processing (NLP). In this lab, we extract image features (like SIFT or SURF) and treat them as "visual words" to build a histogram of visual words for image classification.
   - **Key Concept**: The BoVW model enables efficient image recognition by quantifying image features into a dictionary, allowing us to represent images in a compact form for classification.

### **Lab 4: Image Classification Using Deep Features**
- **Objective**:
   - Extract deep features from images using pre-trained deep learning models such as **VGG16** and **ResNet**. In this lab, we compare the performance of both models in image classification tasks by fine-tuning or using their pre-trained features to classify images.
   - **Goal**: Evaluate the effectiveness of deep features extracted from these models and compare their classification performance on various datasets.
